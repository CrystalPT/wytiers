# WYTiers Deployment Guide

## Push to GitHub

After creating your GitHub repository at https://github.com/new, run:

cd c:\Users\cryst\wytiers
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wytiers.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!

## Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - NOT GitHub Pages!)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your 'wytiers' repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Wait 2 minutes - Done!

Your site will be live at: https://wytiers.vercel.app (or similar)

## Why Not GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages only supports static sites. Your WYTiers app needs:
- Server-side API routes (/api/players, /api/uuid, etc.)
- Firebase Firestore connection
- Next.js server-side rendering

Vercel supports all of this for FREE!

## After Deployment

Your Firebase config in lib/firebase.ts is safe to commit - it's meant to be public.
Just make sure your Firestore security rules are properly configured in Firebase Console.

## Troubleshooting

If you get build errors on Vercel:
1. Check that all dependencies are in package.json
2. Ensure Firebase credentials are correct
3. Check the build logs on Vercel dashboard
